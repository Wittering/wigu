## Domain 1: Joy & Energy
**Question: "When do you feel most alive and lose track of time?"**

### Main Answer:
```
I feel most alive when I'm facilitating workshops or training sessions where I can help people discover new concepts and see their "aha" moments. Last month, I ran a design thinking workshop for a team that was stuck on a product challenge. We spent 4 hours mapping user journeys, brainstorming solutions, and prototyping ideas. I completely lost track of time because I was so energised by the collaborative energy and seeing people build on each other's ideas. There's something magical about creating a space where people feel safe to be creative and vulnerable, and then watching them surprise themselves with what they come up with. I also get this feeling when I'm one-on-one coaching someone through a difficult decision - the deep listening, the powerful questions, and that moment when they discover their own answer.
```

### Sample Probe Responses:
**"Tell me about the last time that happened—what were you doing and with whom?"**
```
It was actually just two weeks ago with our marketing team. They were struggling with how to position our new product feature. I suggested we run a quick ideation session, and what was supposed to be a 30-minute meeting turned into a 2-hour deep dive. We had sticky notes everywhere, were sketching on whiteboards, and building on each other's ideas. By the end, not only did we have a clear positioning strategy, but the team was genuinely excited about it. What energised me most was seeing Sarah, who's usually quite reserved, become the most vocal contributor once she felt the psychological safety to share wild ideas.
```

**"What part gave you the buzz: the challenge, the people, the outcome, the craft?"**
```
Definitely the people and the process. While I love a good challenge and I'm proud of the outcomes we achieve, what really energises me is the human connection and group dynamics. There's something addictive about reading the room, knowing when to push for more ideas and when to focus, seeing someone who's been quiet suddenly light up with a contribution. I love the craft of facilitation itself - the questions I ask, how I frame problems, creating the right environment. It's like conducting an orchestra where everyone gets to be both musician and composer.

## Domain 2: Strengths
**Question: "What do you consistently do better than most—and how do you know?"**

### Main Answer:
```
I consistently excel at making complex ideas accessible and helping people see connections they hadn't noticed before. I know this because colleagues regularly come to me when they need to explain something complicated to a broader audience, and I often get feedback like "you made that so much clearer" or "I never thought about it that way." For example, when our engineering team needed to present their technical roadmap to the board, they asked me to help translate it. I created a visual story that connected their technical choices to business outcomes, and the board not only understood but got genuinely excited about the direction. I also seem to have a natural ability to spot patterns across different projects or conversations and help people see how they connect. Last quarter, I noticed themes emerging from customer interviews across three different products and helped the teams see they were solving the same underlying problem.
```

### Sample Probe Responses:
**"Share a story where that strength changed the outcome—what did you uniquely add?"**
```
Last year, our company was considering a major restructure that would have eliminated the learning and development function. The leadership team saw it as a cost center with unclear ROI. I was asked to present the case for keeping L&D, but instead of showing training metrics, I reframed the conversation entirely. I mapped out how L&D connected to retention, innovation, customer satisfaction, and revenue growth. I used stories and visuals to show the invisible threads between what we do and business outcomes. The result? Not only did they keep L&D, they increased our budget by 40%. What I uniquely added was the ability to translate our work into language that resonated with their priorities and help them see connections they hadn't made before.
```

**"Who's told you this and what exact words did they use?"**
```
My manager said in my last review: "You have this rare ability to take something incredibly complex and make it feel simple and obvious. You don't just simplify - you illuminate." A colleague from product recently told me: "When you explain things, I don't just understand them, I get excited about them." And after that board presentation, the CEO said: "You turned a technical update into a compelling vision - that's a superpower." The feedback I get most often is that I help people see things differently or make connections they wouldn't have made on their own.

## Domain 3: Sought For
**Question: "What do people seek you out for—and which of those asks actually light you up?"**

### Main Answer:
```
People come to me for three main things: facilitation when they have a tricky group dynamic or complex problem to solve, communication help when they need to present something important, and strategic thinking when they're stuck or need a fresh perspective. I also get asked to mediate conflicts or have difficult conversations. What absolutely lights me up is the facilitation and strategic thinking work - I love being the person who helps teams get unstuck or reach breakthrough thinking. The communication coaching energises me too, especially when I can help someone find their authentic voice. However, the conflict mediation drains me. While I'm apparently good at it, it often feels heavy and I carry the emotional weight longer than I should. I'd much rather prevent conflicts through better systems and communication than resolve them after they've escalated.
```

### Sample Probe Responses:
**"List three types of problems people bring you. Which one excites you most?"**
```
1. "We're stuck and can't figure out how to move forward" - strategy and breakthrough thinking
2. "This presentation/proposal/message needs to be clearer and more compelling" - communication
3. "There's tension in the team and we need someone neutral to help sort it out" - conflict resolution

The first one excites me most because it's like solving a puzzle with human creativity. I love the detective work of understanding all the constraints and perspectives, then designing a process that helps people discover solutions they couldn't see before. There's something deeply satisfying about turning a room full of frustrated, stuck people into an energised group with clear next steps.
```

**"What do you wish they'd ask you for instead?"**
```
I wish people would come to me earlier in their thinking process - not when they're already stuck, but when they're designing new initiatives or exploring big questions. I'd love to be brought in to help design better decision-making processes or create systems that prevent problems rather than solve them after they've emerged. I also wish more people would ask for help with personal development and career exploration - not just fixing immediate problems but growing their own facilitation and strategic thinking capabilities.

## Domain 4: Values & Impact
**Question: "If you could help fix or improve one thing over the next few years, what would it be and why?"**

### Main Answer:
```
I want to help organisations create more human-centered ways of working that unlock people's creativity and authentic contribution. Too many talented people are stuck in systems that treat them like resources rather than humans with unique gifts. I see brilliant individuals who feel disengaged because their workplaces don't know how to tap into what makes them come alive. The personal hook for me is that I've experienced both sides - toxic environments that drained my soul and energising cultures where I felt like I could contribute my best work. I believe that when people can bring their whole selves to work and feel genuinely valued for their unique contributions, both they and their organisations thrive. This matters at a human scale - one person finding their authentic voice and contribution can transform their life and ripple out to their family and community. But it also matters at a societal level because we need all of our collective creativity and intelligence to solve the complex challenges we're facing.
```

### Sample Probe Responses:
**"Who benefits and how do their lives change?"**
```
Individuals benefit by feeling more energised, creative, and fulfilled at work. Instead of leaving their authentic selves at the door, they get to contribute what they're genuinely good at and passionate about. Their stress decreases, their confidence grows, and they often discover capabilities they didn't know they had. Teams benefit because you get better collaboration, more innovation, and higher performance when everyone feels safe to contribute fully. Organizations benefit through better retention, increased innovation, and stronger business results. And families benefit because when someone feels fulfilled at work, they bring more positive energy home rather than being drained and depleted.
```

**"Why this problem—what's the personal hook?"**
```
I've lived the contrast. Early in my career, I worked in environments where I felt like I had to hide parts of myself to fit in - my creativity, my questions, my way of approaching problems. I was successful on paper but felt empty inside. Then I experienced workplaces where leaders genuinely cared about what made each person tick and created space for people to contribute authentically. The difference was transformational - not just in my work quality but in my entire wellbeing. I don't want anyone else to spend years hiding their gifts or feeling like their authentic self isn't welcome at work.

## Domain 5: Life Design
**Question: "What does 'a great work life' look like for you—non-negotiables, nice-to-haves, and deal-breakers?"**

### Main Answer:
```
Non-negotiables: Autonomy in how I structure my work and approach problems, continuous learning opportunities, and work that feels meaningful and aligned with my values. I need flexibility to work when and where I'm most productive, and I need to feel like my contributions matter. Nice-to-haves: Collaborative, curious colleagues who challenge my thinking, variety in my work (not doing the same thing every day), opportunities to teach and mentor others, and financial compensation that allows me to live comfortably without constant money stress. Deal-breakers: Micromanagement, toxic team dynamics, work that feels pointless or actively harmful, or rigid structures that don't account for different working styles. I also couldn't work somewhere that expected me to be "on" 24/7 - I need boundaries between work and personal life to recharge. Success in 12 months would look like being known for facilitating breakthrough thinking sessions, having built strong relationships across the organization, and feeling energised rather than drained by my work. Disappointment would be feeling like I'm just going through the motions or that my contributions aren't valued.
```

### Sample Probe Responses:
**"Rank these: pay, autonomy, stability, flexibility, status, learning, impact."**
```
1. Autonomy - This is absolutely critical for me. I need to feel trusted to do my best work.
2. Impact - I need to feel like my work matters and creates positive change.
3. Learning - I get restless if I'm not growing and discovering new things.
4. Flexibility - This enables my best work and supports my wellbeing.
5. Pay - Important for security but not a primary motivator once basic needs are met.
6. Stability - Nice to have but I'd choose growth over safety.
7. Status - Least important to me; I care more about contribution than recognition.
```

**"Describe your ideal week (hours, rhythms, people contact)."**
```
My ideal week has a mix of deep work time, collaborative sessions, and learning/growth activities. I'm most creative in the mornings, so I'd love 2-3 hours of uninterrupted time most days for strategic thinking, writing, or preparation. Afternoons for meetings, workshops, and collaborative work. I thrive on human connection but need alone time to process and recharge. Ideally, 60% collaboration, 40% independent work. Around 35-40 hours of core work, with flexibility to work more during exciting projects and less during slower periods. I'd love one day per week that's learning-focused - whether that's taking a course, attending conferences, or having developmental conversations.
```
